#  HackRice 2019 | Rice’s Zen Garden

## Track Description
Based off the CSS Zen Garden, this track aims to show you the power of CSS. 

“CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.” ([source](https://skillcrush.com/2012/04/03/css/))

Although there are new tools and technologies to help with frontend design, we want to focus our attention back on the basics. CSS is a powerful and often overlooked tool, and we hope with this design track, you will learn something new about CSS. 

## Track Prompt
The goal of this track is to redesign the Rice [residential college website](https://dou.rice.edu/residential-colleges). All of the information currently included on the site must be displayed on your new page, but you are welcome to structure it however you’d like. 

You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.

We’ve provided a sample HTML file containing all the text on the page for you to begin with. Feel free to add images from the website and modify the sample CSS file to incorporate your design ideas. Download the sample HTML and CSS to get started.
