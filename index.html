								Undergraduate life at Rice University differs from that at many universities because of Rice's 
								tradition of residential colleges. Before matriculating, each of the university's undergraduates 
								becomes a member of one of 11 residential colleges, which have their own dining halls, 
								public rooms, and dorms on campus; most of the first-year students and about 75 percent of 
								all undergraduates reside at their associated colleges. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Because each student is randomly assigned to one of the colleges, and maintains membership in 
								the same college throughout their undergraduate years, the colleges are enriched by the 
								diversity of their students' backgrounds, academic interests and experiences, talents, and goals. 
							</p>
							<p>
								A faculty magister, who is assigned to each college and lives in an adjacent house, helps 
								cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as 
								supporting an effective system of self-government. Other faculty or members of the community 
								serve as associates to individual colleges. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The experience of college residence is indispensable to conveying the rich flavor of academic 
								life at Rice, allowing students to combine their usual studies with an array of social events, 
								intramural sports, student plays, lecture series, innovative college-designed courses, and an 
								active role in student government.
							</p>

								Rice University houses students in 11 residential colleges: Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, Wiess, 
								Jones, Brown, Lovett, Sid Richardson, Martel, McMurtry, and Duncan.  Students are randomly 
								assigned to colleges; however, great care is taken to ensure that majors, ethnicities, 
								hometowns, home states, high schools, genders, and athletes, are assigned as evenly as 
								possible among the colleges.  Thus, only the first two of a group of three of more students 
								from the same hometown and high school requesting to be roommates and be assigned to the same 
								college will be honored.  
							</p>
							<p>
								Students are given the option of either requesting to room with a specific incoming student 
								OR be assigned to the same college as a particular incoming student.  Please be aware that 
								both students MUST make the same request in writing by the stated deadline.  Unless there 
								is an immediate family legacy (mother, father, sister, or brother) within a college, 
								students cannot request to be assigned to a specific college. Students with documented 
								disabilities must complete the disability accommodations process, so that Disability Support 
								Services can request an assignment conducive to the specific mobility and accessibility needs.
							</p>
							<p style="text-decoration:underline;">
								Notification of college assignments are mailed via US Mail on July 7th, or the next business day, 
								should the 7th falls on a weekend.

								College Magisters are tenured faculty members who live, with their families, in houses 
								adjacent to each college.  Magisters are a supportive resource for students and oversee 
								all aspects of student life. They encourage broad cultural and intellectual pursuits, ensure 
								the effectiveness of the college's self-governance, and care for their students' wellbeing. 
								College Magisters serve as advisors and confidants; promote responsible student government; 
								encourage student-faculty interaction in the college through cultural and educational 
								programs, social events, and other activities; and help students understand the university's 
								broad curriculum and vast experiential learning opportunities.
							</p>
							<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:2rem;">

								Resident Associates (RAs) are crucial to the Rice University college system, assisting 
								magisters in supporting the intellectual, social, and cultural activities within the college. 
								Living among the students, Resident Associates are in a unique position to be a positive 
								community facilitator, role model, and to provide guidance and leadership to college members. 
								Resident Associates, therefore, must be a visible participant in college life, accessible to 
								students, and willing to stand in for the magisters, when appropriate.
							</p>
							<p>
								The primary goal of every RA should be to support the magisters in the smooth and effective 
								running of the college.  Although the specific role that any particular RA plays may vary with 
								each individual and college, a successful RA will make continual effort to know the members of 
								the college, be accessible to and serve as a point of contact for all students within the 
								college, and help students understand and access university resources. RAs will encourage and 
								contribute actively to the intellectual, cultural, and social life of the college, develop a 
								clear understanding of university policies and procedures, including emergency response 
								protocols, and assist the college magisters and other university officials in responding to 
								students in need.   
							</p>
							<p>
								RAs are appointed by the Dean of Undergraduates for an initial year in the college.  At the 
								end of the first year, RAs are evaluated by their college magisters, who may then recommend a 
								three-year appointment, subject to final approval by the Dean of Undergraduates.  The 
								three-year appointment may be repeated once for a maximum total of seven years.  However, all 
								RAs will be evaluated each year, and the magisters or the dean may exercise the option of not 
								renewing an appointment at any time.  Service is conditioned on satisfactory performance.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span style="font-weight:bold;"> Minimum qualifications for RAs: </span>
								<ul class="text-left">
									<li> Full-time faculty or staff at Rice University </li>
									<li> Employed or studied at Rice for at least a year before start of RA term </li>
									<li> Recent Rice undergraduate alumni, who fulfill all other requirements, must have graduated at least four years prior to appointment </li>
									<li> All RAs must be in good standing in their employment status </li>
									<li> All RAs (including non-Rice RAs) need to satisfactorily complete a background check </li>
									<li> RAs are appointed by the Dean of Undergraduates </li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								Resident Associate openings are announced by the college and the Office of the Dean of 
								Undergraduates.  The colleges connect with the dean's office about the format of the search 
								process and coordinate opportunities to meet candidates at programs and events at the colleges. 
								The Office of the Dean of Undergraduates will host RA Information Sessions once openings are 
								announced, which can provide considerably greater detail about the role and responsibities of 
								RAs. Competitive candidates are selected to interview with the college.  The magister(s) select 
								the finalists and the dean's office appoints RAs to their position.

								College coordinators are staff members who serve as daytime contacts for students within 
								their assigned college. They typically keep a 9-5 schedule and their duties include managing 
								the college's office budget, notifying students of important deadlines, sorting the mail, and 
								acting as the primary contact between the residential colleges and other university offices. 
								The college coordinator's office is the nerve center of the college, a main meeting place where 
								students stop by to chat and get answers to questions on everything from how to pay a parking 
								ticket, replace a room key or when to meet important deadlines.

							In 1957 William V. Houston, Rice's second President, initiated the college system, making 
							Hanszen College one of the four original colleges. The college took the name Hanszen in honor 
							of Harry Clay Hanszen, a member of the Rice University Board of Governors from 1946-1950, and 
							whose wealth came from his ventures in the oil industry. Though long ago Hanszen was known as 
							the "Gentlemen's College" and "The Uncollege," we are now known as the "Family College," a 
							reflection of the close and caring relations among its members. Our current Commons, built 
							in 2002, is a beautiful modern space where you will experience hours of games, fun, and

							university's first president. Lovett opened in 1969 as an all-male college, becoming 
							co-ed in 1980 when members of the college exchanged places with the female members of 
							Jones College. Lovett's first class mostly comprised volunteers from other colleges. 
							Lovett sponsors numerous community and social events throughout the year, including theater 
							productions and the Lovett Undergraduate Research Symposium. Lovett's college crest is based 
							upon the Lovat family crest although the Lovat family is not related to Edgar Odell Lovett.

							Sid Richardson College (also referred to as Sid, SRC, or Sid Rich) opened in 1971 
							as a men's residential college. Like the other residential colleges on the Rice 
							campus, Sid Richardson College provides undergraduate residential and dining facilities, 
							social organizations and student government, as well as faculty, alumni, and community 
							associates. A $2 million pledge from the Sid Richardson Foundation, which was established 
							by Texas oilman, cattleman, and philanthropist Sid W. Richardson (1891 - 1959), funded the 
							construction of the college. The college became co-ed in 1987. Members of Sid Richardson 
							College are called Sidizens.

							in which students will most likely have classes), Duncan Hall (for all things engineering),
