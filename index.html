				Undergraduate life at Rice University differs from that at many universities because of Rice's tradition of residential colleges. Before matriculating, each of the university's undergraduates becomes a member of one of 11 residential colleges, which have their own dining halls, public rooms, and dorms on campus; most of the first-year students and about 75 percent of all undergraduates reside at their associated colleges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Because each student is randomly assigned to one of the colleges, and maintains membership in the same college throughout their undergraduate years, the colleges are enriched by the diversity of their students' backgrounds, academic interests and experiences, talents, and goals. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A faculty magister, who is assigned to each college and lives in an adjacent house, helps cultivate a variety of cultural and intellectual interests among the students, as well as supporting an effective system of self-government. Other faculty or members of the community serve as associates to individual colleges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The experience of college residence is indispensable to conveying the rich flavor of academic life at Rice, allowing students to combine their usual studies with an array of social events, intramural sports, student plays, lecture series, innovative college-designed courses, and an active role in student government.

			<h3>Hanszen College</h3>
			<p>
				In 1957 William V. Houston, Rice's second President, initiated the college system, making Hanszen College one of the four original colleges. The college took the name Hanszen in honor of Harry Clay Hanszen, a member of the Rice University Board of Governors from 1946-1950, and whose wealth came from his ventures in the oil industry.

			<h3>Jones College</h3>
			<p>
				Jones College was built as the first women's dormitory at Rice University. In the fall of 1980, Jones made a major change that would alter life at the college forever - it went co-ed! Since Jones became co-ed, Jones women have won the women's race a total of four times. Jones has a crazy amount of college spirit, and plenty of ways to get involved. JIBA!
